# Enhancer for Nebula

Heavily inspired by [Enhancer for YouTube&trade;](https://www.mrfdev.com/enhancer-for-youtube)

This extension aspires to bring some useful features to the [Nebula](https://watchnebula.com) site.



# Installing

This extension is available on the official add-on stores:

- Firefox: [Get from Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/enhancer-for-nebula/)
- Chromium: [Get from Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enhancer-for-nebula/niaholaehmipmbpoagjmdlocnhakeonl?hl=de)

The most recent releases are available [here](https://github.com/cpiber/NebulaEnhance/releases).

Please be aware that both Mozilla and Google need to verify my changes before making them visible in the stores. Especially for the Chrome Webstore this takes time.
