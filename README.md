# Enhancer for Nebula

Heavily inspired by [Enhancer for YouTube&trade;](https://www.mrfdev.com/enhancer-for-youtube)

This extension aspires to bring some useful features to the [Nebula](https://nebula.app) site.



# Installing

This extension is available on the official add-on stores:

- Firefox: [![amo](https://badgen.net/amo/v/enhancer-for-nebula)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/enhancer-for-nebula/) 
- Chromium: [![chrome](https://badgen.net/chrome-web-store/v/niaholaehmipmbpoagjmdlocnhakeonl)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enhancer-for-nebula/niaholaehmipmbpoagjmdlocnhakeonl)

The most recent releases are available [here](https://github.com/cpiber/NebulaEnhance/releases).

Please be aware that both Mozilla and Google need to verify my changes before making them visible in the stores. Especially for the Chrome Webstore this takes time.
